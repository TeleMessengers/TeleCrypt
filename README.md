White label messenger based on [Trixnity Messenger](https://gitlab.com/connect2x/trixnity-messenger/trixnity-messenger).
Please consult the Readme there for additional information.

## Run locally

If you run the messenger from the IDE or command line, the

### Desktop

`./gradlew run`

### Android

In Android Studio or IntelliJ, choose the Android configuration and run on an emulated or your physical device.

### Web

Please **note**: web is still experimental and is missing some features that are present in the other versions. We are
working on it.

`./gradlew webBrowserDevelopmentRun`

## Create release

1. Create a git commit with
    - `appPublishedVersion` (e. g. `1.2.3`) set to the version that is going to be published.
    - `appVersion` must be the same as `appPublishedVersion`.
    - Updated `CHANGELOG.md` containing a section about the new version.
2. Create a version-tag of the form `v1.2.3`.
    - The version must be the same as `appPublishedVersion`.
    - This will trigger a pipeline creating all distributions, uploading them into package registry and linking them in
      a newly created GitLab release.
3. Create a git commit with
    - `appPublishedVersion` (e. g. `1.2.3`) stays at the version, that has been published.
    - `appVersion` increased to the next version as this is used for `DEV` builds.

## Fastlane

When running locally, you must set `TAMMY_BUILD_FLAVOR` to `PROD` (e.g. by prepending `TAMMY_BUILD_FLAVOR=PROD` to each
command).

### Create screenshots

Create new screenshots for the App.

When using a Mac, you may do first (this needs Android SDK command line tools to be installed):

```bash
export PATH="$PATH:$HOME/Library/Android/sdk/emulator:$HOME/Library/Android/sdk/tools:$HOME/Library/Android/sdk/cmdline-tools/latest/bin/"
```

After that you can start the emulators:

```bash
./fastlane/run_screenshot_emulators.sh
```

And create screenshots:

```bash
TAMMY_BUILD_FLAVOR=PROD fastlane android screenshots
```

After that you can stop the first script and delete the emulators:

```bash
./fastlane/delete_screenshot_emulators.sh
```
